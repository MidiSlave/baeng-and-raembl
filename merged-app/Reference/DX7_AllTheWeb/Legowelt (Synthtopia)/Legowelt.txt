Dutch composer & synthesist Danny Wolfers (Legowelt) & Dim Garden have released a new album, The Art Of DX7.

Wolfers describes The Art Of DX7 album as a collection of “Synthesizer folks songs, full with nostalgia and yearning.” The album was made on a vintage Yamaha DX7.

In addition to the album, Wolfers has released a free library of the sounds that he used on the album. If you have a DX7 or a synthesizer that can read the DX7’s patches, you can download the sounds used on the album in .syx format.

You can also use them with Dexed, which can be used to preview and play the sounds, both as a standalone application and as a VST for your DAW.
